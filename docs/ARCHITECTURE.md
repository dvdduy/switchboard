# Architecture

## Architectural style

Switchboard begins as a **modular monolith with a separate background worker**. This provides strong transactional boundaries and simple local operation while preserving modules that could later become independently deployed control-plane or data-plane services.

LangGraph is an orchestration adapter. Switchboard owns the public execution model, state machine, persistence, APIs, and guarantees.

## Control plane and data plane

### Control plane

- agent and tool registration;
- policy configuration;
- eval dataset and evaluator management;
- release creation and rollout transitions;
- disabling unhealthy tools;
- inspection and audit APIs.

### Data plane

- accept conversation turns;
- persist and dispatch work;
- load context;
- route tools;
- evaluate policies;
- wait for approval;
- invoke tools;
- call models;
- stream committed events;
- recover from retries and failure.

They initially share one codebase and database but have separate modules and contracts.

## Target runtime turn flow

The following end-to-end outbox, worker, routing, policy, tool, and model flow is
the target architecture; Day 3 implements only the durable event/simulator and
SSE delivery subset described in the implementation notes below.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant API
    participant DB as PostgreSQL
    participant Worker
    participant Router
    participant Policy
    participant Tool
    participant Model

    Client->>API: POST conversation turn
    API->>DB: message + turn + outbox (one transaction)
    API-->>Client: 202 Accepted + turn ID
    Worker->>DB: claim outbox / turn
    Worker->>DB: append ROUTING event
    Worker->>Router: select eligible tool or fallback
    Router-->>Worker: structured routing decision
    Worker->>Policy: evaluate action
    alt confirmation required
        Worker->>DB: persist approval request and pause
        API-->>Client: SSE approval.required
        Client->>API: approve request
        API->>DB: persist approval and dispatch resume
    end
    Worker->>Tool: invoke with stable idempotency key
    Tool-->>Worker: structured result
    Worker->>Model: generate final response
    Model-->>Worker: streamed tokens/events
    Worker->>DB: persist committed events and completion
    API-->>Client: SSE committed events
```

## Durable dispatch

Target architecture, not yet implemented: the API transaction will commit:

1. user message;
2. `TurnExecution` in `RECEIVED`;
3. initial execution event;
4. outbox record.

The future worker will claim outbox records and advance the state machine. Day 3
does not yet provide the transactional outbox, durable claiming, or recovery.

## Execution state machine

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> RECEIVED
    RECEIVED --> ROUTING
    ROUTING --> NEEDS_CLARIFICATION
    ROUTING --> AWAITING_CONFIRMATION
    ROUTING --> READY
    NEEDS_CLARIFICATION --> COMPLETED
    AWAITING_CONFIRMATION --> READY: approved
    AWAITING_CONFIRMATION --> CANCELLED: rejected/expired
    READY --> EXECUTING_TOOL
    EXECUTING_TOOL --> GENERATING_RESPONSE
    EXECUTING_TOOL --> UNKNOWN_OUTCOME
    EXECUTING_TOOL --> FAILED
    UNKNOWN_OUTCOME --> GENERATING_RESPONSE: reconciled success
    UNKNOWN_OUTCOME --> READY: reconciled safe retry
    UNKNOWN_OUTCOME --> FAILED: terminal review
    GENERATING_RESPONSE --> COMPLETED
    RECEIVED --> CANCELLED
    ROUTING --> FAILED
    GENERATING_RESPONSE --> FAILED
```

Not every turn calls a tool. A direct-response path may move from routing to generation.

## Tool-routing pipeline

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Registry[Active bound tools] --> Auth[Authorization filter]
    Auth --> Health[Availability filter]
    Health --> Retrieve[Embedding candidate retrieval]
    Retrieve --> Select[Structured final selection]
    Select --> Outcome{Outcome}
    Outcome -->|Selected| Policy[Policy evaluation]
    Outcome -->|Ambiguous| Clarify[Clarifying question]
    Outcome -->|No match| Fallback[Fallback response]
    Outcome -->|Unavailable| Explain[Availability fallback]
```

## Policy boundary

The policy engine receives a complete request context and returns one of:

- `ALLOW`;
- `DENY`;
- `REQUIRE_CONFIRMATION`;
- `REQUIRE_ELEVATED_APPROVAL`.

The executor never bypasses the policy result. Approvals are separate durable records with actor, scope, expiration, and argument fingerprint.

## Tool execution contract

Each invocation includes:

- immutable tool version;
- validated arguments;
- stable logical invocation ID and idempotency key;
- caller identity and delegated scopes;
- timeout and retry policy;
- trace context.

Each result maps to a platform error taxonomy. A timeout after dispatch of a mutation may become `UNKNOWN_OUTCOME`; it is not blindly retried.

## Streaming model

SSE is used because the primary direction is server-to-client event delivery.
Implemented events have monotonically increasing turn-local sequence numbers
allocated under a PostgreSQL turn-row lock. A reconnecting client supplies a
non-negative `Last-Event-ID`; the API treats it as an exclusive cursor, replays
committed events in order, and then follows newly committed events.

The Day 3 simulator emits stable `response.delta` chunks rather than exposing
provider token objects. A framework-independent replay service polls PostgreSQL
with short independent units of work, never sleeps or yields with a transaction
open, and closes after a terminal event. Redis is not required for correctness;
notification-assisted polling remains a future optimization.

`GET /api/v1/turns/{turn_id}/events` is read-only. Disconnecting or cancelling
one observer does not mutate execution or affect another observer. Production
retention and chunk-size tuning remain undefined.

## Persistence ownership

- PostgreSQL: source of truth for configuration, conversation, execution, approval, audit, eval, and release state.
- Redis: ephemeral cache, rate-limit counters, leases, and connection coordination.
- Object storage: deferred; may later hold large eval artifacts or traces.

## Evaluation architecture

Offline evaluation is a control-plane job. It pins versions, runs deterministic checks first, optionally runs a calibrated judge, writes case-level results, compares against a baseline, and emits a pass/fail release decision.

Live rollout protection consumes operational signals. It does not rerun the entire offline golden dataset on every production turn.

## Deployment

Current Docker Compose services:

```text
api
worker
postgres
postgres-test (test profile)
redis
```

Planned additions:

```text
eval-runner
rollout-simulator
```

The API and worker use the same application/domain packages but different entry points.

## Scaling path

Only when measurement justifies it:

1. scale workers horizontally with database-backed claiming;
2. separate eval workloads from conversation workers;
3. move durable dispatch to a managed queue while preserving outbox semantics;
4. isolate control-plane APIs;
5. partition high-volume execution-event storage;
6. introduce multi-region ownership rules.

No microservice split is required merely to demonstrate seniority.


## Implementation status after Day 3

Implemented:

- one repository with separate API and worker entry points;
- inward domain/application/adapters/bootstrap dependency direction;
- FastAPI health and readiness endpoints;
- PostgreSQL and Redis runtime resources;
- SQLAlchemy Core persistence, Alembic, repository ports, and unit of work;
- durable versioned-agent, conversation, message, turn, and attempt records;
- atomic conversation start and PostgreSQL integration tests;
- immutable JSON-compatible execution events associated with logical turns and
  optional physical attempts;
- turn-local event sequence allocation, locked append, exclusive-cursor reads,
  lifecycle compare-and-set updates, and relational ownership constraints;
- deterministic simulated execution with durable chunks, atomic success output,
  and durable terminal failure after partial progress;
- framework-independent replay-then-tail polling over short transactions;
- reconnectable SSE with exact event IDs/types, compact JSON payloads, preflight
  validation, terminal closure, and independent observers.

Planned but not yet implemented:

- public conversation commands;
- transactional outbox and worker claiming;
- durable worker recovery;
- real model-provider execution;
- Redis-assisted event notification;
- event retention and production chunk-size tuning;
- context management, tool routing, policies, approvals, model adapters,
  evaluation, and rollout control.
